# OCR Conversion Error Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Syntax Error in diagnostic-panel.js ✅

**Error:**
```
Uncaught SyntaxError: export declarations may only appear at top level of a module
diagnostic-panel.js:346:1
```

**Root Cause:**
- The file `public/js/diagnostic-panel.js` had an ES6 `export default` statement at the end
- However, it was loaded as a regular script (not a module) in `index.html`
- Export statements are only valid in ES modules

**Fix:**
- Removed the `export default DiagnosticPanel;` statement from diagnostic-panel.js
- The file already exposes functionality via `window.diagnosticPanel`, so the export was unnecessary

**Files Changed:**
- `public/js/diagnostic-panel.js` (line 346 removed)

### 2. BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN Configuration Error ✅

**Error:**
```
Error: BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN environment variable is not configured.
Please set it in Vercel Dashboard.
```

**Root Cause:**
- The application was running in production mode (or with `FORCE_BLOB=true`)
- Production mode requires Vercel Blob Storage for file uploads
- The `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` environment variable was either:
  - Not set at all, OR
  - Set to the placeholder value `vercel_blob_rw_xxxxxxxxxxxxx`

**Fixes Applied:**

1. **Enhanced Error Handling** (`api/utils/storage.js`):
   - Improved error message with step-by-step setup instructions
   - Added detection of placeholder token value
   - Provides different guidance for local development vs. production

2. **Health Check Endpoint** (`api/health.js` - NEW):
   - Created `/api/health` endpoint to check system configuration
   - Detects missing or invalid BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN
   - Returns detailed status including environment info and warnings

3. **Frontend Configuration Warning** (`public/js/main.js`):
   - Added `checkHealth()` method that runs on app initialization
   - Displays a prominent warning banner if BLOB token is not configured
   - User-friendly message explains the issue and how to fix it

4. **Setup Documentation** (`SETUP.md` - NEW):
   - Comprehensive guide for local development setup
   - Step-by-step instructions for Vercel deployment
   - Troubleshooting section for common errors

**Files Changed:**
- `api/utils/storage.js` (enhanced error handling at lines 115-134)
- `api/health.js` (NEW - health check endpoint)
- `public/js/main.js` (added checkHealth() and showConfigurationWarning())
- `SETUP.md` (NEW - setup documentation)

## How to Fix the BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN Error

### For Local Development (Quick Fix)

1. Open `.env.local`
2. Ensure `NODE_ENV=development`
3. Restart your dev server

The app will use local file storage instead of Vercel Blob.

### For Production / Vercel Deployment

1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **Storage** tab
4. Create a **Blob Store** (if you don't have one)
5. Copy the **Read-Write Token**
6. Go to **Settings → Environment Variables**
7. Add: `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` = `your_actual_token`
8. Redeploy your application

## Testing the Fixes

After applying these fixes:

1. **No more syntax errors** - diagnostic-panel.js loads correctly
2. **Clear error messages** - if BLOB token is missing, you'll see:
   - A warning banner at the top of the page
   - Detailed instructions in the console
   - Helpful error message from the API

3. **Health Check** - visit `/api/health` to see system status:
   ```json
   {
     "status": "healthy",
     "environment": {
       "nodeEnv": "development",
       "useBlobStorage": false,
       "blobTokenConfigured": false
     },
     "warnings": [],
     "errors": []
   }
   ```

## Next Steps

1. **For Development**: Ensure `NODE_ENV=development` in `.env.local`

3. **Test OCR**: Upload a PDF and verify the conversion works
4. **Monitor**: Check `/api/health` endpoint for any configuration issues

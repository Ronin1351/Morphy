# Bank Statement to Excel Converter
## Project Proposal

---

## Executive Summary

This proposal outlines a project to develop an automated solution for converting bank statement PDFs into structured Excel files. The solution will streamline financial data processing, reduce manual data entry errors, and improve operational efficiency for [organization/team].

---

## 1. Project Overview

### Background
Bank statements are currently processed manually, requiring staff to extract transaction data from PDFs and manually enter them into spreadsheets. This process is time-consuming, error-prone, and not scalable as transaction volumes increase.

### Problem Statement
- Manual data extraction from PDFs is labor-intensive
- High risk of transcription errors
- Inconsistent formatting across different bank statement types
- Time spent on data entry could be allocated to higher-value analysis

### Proposed Solution
Develop an automated converter that extracts transaction data from bank statement PDFs and outputs clean, organized Excel files ready for analysis and record-keeping.

---

## 2. Project Scope

### In Scope
- Extract transaction data (date, description, amount, balance) from PDF bank statements
- Handle multiple bank formats and statement layouts
- Generate standardized Excel output with consistent formatting
- Input validation and error handling
- Support for batch processing of multiple statements

### Out of Scope
- Real-time bank API integration
- Multi-currency conversion or reconciliation
- Integration with accounting software (Phase 2 consideration)

---

## 3. Objectives & Goals

**Primary Objectives:**
1. Eliminate manual PDF-to-Excel data entry process
2. Achieve 99%+ accuracy in data extraction
3. Reduce processing time per statement from [X] hours to [Y] minutes
4. Create a reusable, maintainable solution

**Success Metrics:**
- Accuracy rate: 99%+ correct data extraction
- Processing time: [target time] per batch
- Error reduction: 90%+ decrease in manual entry errors
- User adoption: All relevant staff trained and using system

---

## 4. Deliverables

1. **Functional Converter Tool** - Automated PDF parser with Excel output capability
2. **User Documentation** - Step-by-step guides and troubleshooting
3. **Training Materials** - Documentation for staff on how to use the solution
4. **Test Results** - Validation against sample bank statements
5. **Source Code** - Well-documented, maintainable codebase
6. **Deployment Guide** - Instructions for implementation and setup
